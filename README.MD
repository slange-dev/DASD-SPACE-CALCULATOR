# SPACE Calculator

I kept forgetting all the parameters for making a new dataset, so I created 
the following, one page, HTML file to make the calculations easier. 

I added tooltips, etc for people new to mainframes.

You can either download the html and run it locally, or use it here: https://mvs-sysgen.github.io/SPACE
